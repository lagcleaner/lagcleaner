# 👋 Hey there! My name is [**Leonel Alejandro García López (lagcleaner)**](https://lagcleaner.github.io)

> I’m a **Computer Science graduate** with a passion for solving problems through code, making systems more efficient, and automating everything—because, (let’s be honest, who enjoys repetitive tasks? 🤷‍♂️). I love working on projects that challenge me, whether it’s AI, Data Science, Backend, Mobile Development, or DevOps (pretty much anything that keeps me learning 🤠). Always open to collaborations, research, and new opportunities. 🚀
